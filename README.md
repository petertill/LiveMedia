## 🎵 LiveMedia: Always-On Media Control

## 🌟 Project Goal
The goal of **LiveMedia** is to transform standard notifications into a **persistent, glanceable, and interactive experience**. This application is designed exclusively for **Android 16 and newer**, with a preference for Google Pixel phones.

LiveMedia uses promoted ongoing notifications to create a "Live Activity" effect. Through the in-app settings, you can customize which elements are displayed, such as album art, artist and album names, and playback controls.

It does not show any live notifications on the lock screen or Quick Settings to avoid duplication with the default media player.

---

## 🛠️ Code Description

The codebase is organized into the following key modules:

- **`lockscreen`**: Manages the visibility of the media controls on the lock screen.
- **`media`**: Handles media state management, including the `MusicState` data class.
- **`notification`**: Contains the `MediaNotificationListenerService` for intercepting media notifications and the `NotificationUpdateScheduler` for updating the custom notification.
- **`qs`**: Manages Quick Settings state and disable notifications when Quick Settings are opened.
- **`ui`**: Defines the Jetpack Compose UI. This includes the `PermissionScreen` for handling permission requests, the `SettingsScreen` for customizing notification content.
- **`storage`**: Manages persistent user preferences for notification content using `SharedPreferences`.
- **`permission`**: Responsible for permission requests and validating state
- **`utils`**: Provides utility functions for logging and notification management.

## 🚀 Setup and Permissions

Since LiveMedia intercepts system notifications, explicit user permission is required.

### Required Permissions

| Permission | Reason |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Notification Listener** | Required by `MediaNotificationListenerService` to access media metadata and session tokens. |
| **Accessibility Service** | Required by `QSStateListener` to detect when Quick Settings or the Notification Shade is opened, allowing the app to hide notifications during user interaction. |

### Live Updates note:

You may need to manually open app notification settings and allow to use Live Updates. It's not required on PixelOS, but it may be required on other vendors, such as OnePlus.
